Arrays & Data Types (1D)

- Declare an array of 10 integers. Read values from the keyboard and print them in reverse order.
- Find the maximum and minimum values in an integer array.
- Calculate the sum and average of an integer array.
- Count how many even and odd numbers exist in an integer array.
- Count how many positive, negative, and zero values exist in an integer array.
- Copy all elements from one array into another.
- Reverse an array in place (without using a second array).
- Merge two arrays of the same size into one (concatenation).
- Find the second-largest element in an array.
- Shift all elements of an array to the left by 1 position (the first element becomes the last).

Functions (with arrays and numbers)

- Write a function that receives an integer array and returns its maximum.
- Write a function that receives an integer array and returns its average.
- Write a function that counts how many times a given number appears in an array.
- Write a function that checks if an array is sorted in ascending order.
- Write a function that merges two arrays and returns a new array with the result.
- Write a function that returns the index of the first occurrence of a given number in an array (or -1 if not found).
- Write a function that finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.
- Write a function that finds the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers.
- Write a function that receives an array and a number, and returns a new array with all elements greater than that number.
- Write a function that checks if a number is prime. Use it to print all primes from an array.

Matrices (2D arrays)

- Read a 3x3 matrix from the keyboard and print it.
- Find the sum of all elements in a matrix.
- Find the sum of the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal of a square matrix.
- Find the transpose of a matrix.
- Multiply every element of a matrix by a given constant.
- Add two matrices of the same size.
- Multiply two matrices (basic algorithm).
- Check if a matrix is symmetric (equals its transpose).
- Find the maximum element in a matrix and its position (row, column).
- Rotate a square matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
