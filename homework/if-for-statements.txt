1. Create a program to illustrate the importance of using the equals method for string comparison instead of using the == operator. Show cases where == gives incorrect results due to String interning.
2. Develop a program that uses equality operators inside conditional statements (like if-else) to branch the code based on the equality of variables. Use both primitive data types and objects in your examples.
3. Create a program that demonstrates how to use equality operators in complex expressions, involving logical operators (&&, ||). Illustrate how to construct complex conditions using equality operators and logical operators.
4. Create a simple program that takes a number as input and uses if-else statements to categorize the number as "positive," "negative," or "zero."
5. Create a program that reads a character from the user and uses nested if statements to determine if the character is a lowercase letter, an uppercase letter, a digit, or a special character.
6. Write a program that uses a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10, each on a new line.
7. Create a program that uses an enhanced for loop to find and print the sum of all elements in an array.
8. Create a program that takes a number as input and uses the ternary operator to print whether the number is "positive" or "non-positive".
9. Enhance the program from problem 8 to also identify zero separately using nested ternary operators.
10. Create a program that takes three numbers as input and uses the ternary operator to find and print the largest number among them.
11. Develop a program that uses a for loop to count the number of even and odd numbers in a range from 1 to n, where n is input by the user. Print the counts.
12. Write a program that uses a for loop to find all the factors of a number n, where n is a user-input number. Print all factors in a single line separated by a space.
